Apte English-Sanskrit Dictionary

The issues of this repository pertain to the digitized versin of this dictionary at 
http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/.

To facilitate corrections to this digitization, a subsidiary version has been created on
the Wikisource web-site.  This repository may also contain programs and procedures 
developed to coordinate the Wikisource version and the Cologne version.
